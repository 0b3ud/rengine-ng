🔖&nbsp; &nbsp; Say Hello to Projects! reNgine-ng 2.0 introduces a powerful addition that enables you to efficiently organize your web application reconnaissance efforts. With this feature, you can create distinct project spaces, each tailored to a specific purpose, such as personal bug bounty hunting, client engagements, or any other specialized recon task. Each projects will have separate dashboard and all the scan results will be separated from each projects, while scan engines and configuration will be shared across all the projects.

⚙️&nbsp; &nbsp; Roles and Permissions! Begining reNgine-ng 2.0, we've taken your web application reconnaissance to a whole new level of control and security. Now, you can assign distinct roles to your team members—Sys Admin, Penetration Tester, and Auditor—each with precisely defined permissions to tailor their access and actions within the reNgine-ng ecosystem.

* 🔐 Sys Admin: Sys Admin is a super user that has permission to modify system and scan related configurations, scan engines, create new users, add new tools etc. Super user can initiate scans and subscans effortlessly.

* 🔍 Penetration Tester: Penetration Tester will be allowed to modify and initiate scans and subscans, add or update targets, etc. A penetration tester will not be allowed to modify system configurations.
* 📊 Auditor: Auditor can only view and download the report. An auditor can not change any system or scan related configurations nor can initiate any scans or subscans.

🚀&nbsp;&nbsp; GPT Vulnerability Report Generation: Get ready for the future of penetration testing reports with reNgine-ng's groundbreaking feature: "GPT-Powered Report Generation"! With the power of OpenAI's GPT, reNgine-ng now provides you with detailed vulnerability descriptions, remediation strategies, and impact assessments that read like they were written by a human security expert! **But that's not all!** Our GPT-driven reports go the extra mile by scouring the web for related news articles, blogs, and references, so you have a 360-degree view of the vulnerabilities you've uncovered.

### Quick Installation

**Note:** Only Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone this repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Security-Tools-Alliance/rengine-ng && cd rengine-ng
    ```

1. Edit the dotenv file, **please make sure to change the password for postgresql `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`!**

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

1. In the dotenv file, you may also modify the Scaling Configurations

    ```bash
    MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
    MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
    ```

    MAX_CONCURRENCY: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine-ng's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximized performance.

    MIN_CONCURRENCY: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

    These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity

1. Run the installation script, Please keep an eye for any prompt, you will also be asked for username and password for reNgine-ng.

### Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire and create. Every contributions you make is **greatly appreciated**. Your contributions can be as simple as fixing the indentation or UI, or as complex as adding new modules and features.

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

You can also [join our Discord channel #development](https://discord.gg/KE5QGTqJpS) for any development related questions.
Channel is restricted, so please ask an admin to give you the correct role.

### Submitting issues

You can submit issues related to this project, but you should do it in a way that helps developers to resolve it as quickly as possible.

For that, you need to add as much valuable information as possible.

You can have this valuable information by following these steps:

* Go to the root of the git cloned project
* Shutdown your current production instance by typing `make down`
* Launch the dev environment by typing `make dev_up`
* Then you can start `make logs` and run into your issue, you should now have a more detailed log (stack trace ...)
* To deactivate the dev environment, run `make dev_down`, then restart the prod with `make up`

Example with the tool arsenal version check API bug.

```bash
web_1          |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/celery/app/task.py", line 411, in __call__
web_1          |     return self.run(*args, **kwargs)
web_1          | TypeError: run_command() got an unexpected keyword argument 'echo'
```

Now you know the real error is `TypeError: run_command() got an unexpected keyword argument 'echo'`, and you can post the full stack trace to your newly created issue to help developers to track the root cause of the bug and correct the bug easily.

**Activating debug like this also give you the Django Debug Toolbar on the left side & full stack trace in the browser** instead of an error 500 without any details.
So don't forget to open the developer console and check for any XHR request with error 500.
If there's any, check the response of this request to get your detailed error.
